 Two set of MIP files are provided (for the low and high values of the dual gains)
 First set corresponds to the settings with the gains optimzied for DESY energies (~GeV electrons) - 1.2pF for thick sensorrs (more than 320um) and 0.8pF for the 320um
             --> https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2336
 Second set corresponds to the settings optimzied for CERN energies (and ILC with ~100GeV electrons) - 6pF for all layers
             -->  https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2324
 Layer geometry explained here https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2325
# Important NOTE --> the mip scans are from before the layer reshufling explained here https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2325 but the output files ahve been reshuffled to match the ordering described in the elog entry

Two different methods are used, for the pedestal calculation.

- the standard one (without special name) doing gaussian fits to the pedestal distributions (hit-bit=0)
- method 2 based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7095.pdf
   ---> this one is taken as default one
