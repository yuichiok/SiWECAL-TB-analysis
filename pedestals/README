# Two set of pedestal files are provided (for the low and high values of the dual gains)
# First set corresponds to the settings with the gains optimzied for DESY energies (~GeV electrons) - 1.2pF for thick sensorrs (more than 320um) and 0.8pF for the 320um
#             --> https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2336
# Second set corresponds to the settings optimzied for CERN energies (and ILC with ~100GeV electrons) - 6pF for all layers
#             -->  https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2324
# Layer geometry explained here https://llrelog.in2p3.fr/calice/2325

Two different methods and files.

- the standard one (without special name) doing gaussian fits to the pedestal distributions (hit-bit=0)
- method 2 based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7095.pdf
   ---> this one is taken as default one
